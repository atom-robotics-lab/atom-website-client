That adrenaline rush is just what each of us craves. And that’s precisely how we, A.T.O.M. Labs, started this journey. The A.T.O.M. Labs recently attended Cognizance, IIT Roorkee’s prestigious annual technical festival, on a journey fuelled by creativity and fellowship. Our team found itself in the center of a flurry of robotics challenges, enthralling concerts, and exhilarating gaming tournaments as the best technical brains in the country converged. One of the best things was getting to work on different robotics projects and thinking out of the box to make every approach better than before."

Armed with a formidable array of sensors and components, including three ultrasonic sensors, four IR sensors, Arduino Uno, two motors, and a motor driver, our quest for perfection began. Despite initial setbacks with Flood Fill algorithm implementation, we pivoted to a left wall following strategy, harnessing the power of precise sensor data to guide our bot through labyrinthine corridors. With a chassis crafted from 3D-printed parts and acrylic sheet, our creation embodied resilience and agility, weaving through the maze with grace and precision."

        "content": "If you are reading this blog, then either you know what hackathons are or you are eager to find out. In any case, let me just brief you about ‘Hackathons’.\n\nHackathons are generally overnight events in which makers and engineers get together as teams to create a solution from scratch for some real-world problems. Some hackathons target very generic industries like Healthcare, Education, FinTech etc. while others target really specific problem statements like ‘Building an Autonomous Solution for Counting Large Steel Pipes for Inventory Management.\n\nParticipants in a 24 - 36 hour period of the hackathon, not only brainstorm over the technical aspects of a project but also over the real-world implementation of their solution as a business. Hackathons are a great opportunity for getting yourself acquainted with new technologies and new people. So even if you don’t complete your project in time, you still got a ton of networking to do which is equally helpful.\n\nSo basically the benefits of a hackathon can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Lots of challenging problems solving and brainstorming\n- Working on new technologies and stacks\n- Lots and Lots of Networking\n- A whole day of fun and free food (we all love that, don’t we?)\n- Tons and Tons of swags like T-shirts, stickers, badges etc. (We all like to wear those t-shirts as badges of honor 😎)\n- And do you know the best part? It’s that well-earned sleep that comes after spending a whole sleepless 24 hours working 😴.\n\nIf you want to know more about hackathons, I recommend reading Advice to Students for Hackathons by Abhas Abhinav."

The team developed a hardware-based project for monitoring the working conditions of workers in hazardous conditions like coal mines. The project consisted of a smart wearable device (image below), which could be attached to the belt of the worker, like a holster. This piece of hardware contained a plethora of sensors like accelerometer, smoke sensor, humidity sensor and temperature sensor. Long-range RF transceiver modules were used to transfer this data to a central hub that was connected to the internet. This data was then visualized on a web-based dashboard, where an admin could monitor sensory data for each worker. The real-time sensor data could be used to detect emergency conditions like fall detection, gas leak etc.\n\nTech Stack Used in the Project:\n\n- Esp32 connected to the internet for a central hub\n- Arduino Uno for each wearable Devices\n- DHT11 temperature Sensor, MPU6050 Accelerometer, MQ2 Gas Sensor\n- HC-12 Transceiver modules with helical antenna for Long Range RF communication\n- Grafana for Data visualization Dashboard\n- MQTT for real-time communication between Central hub and Dashboard\n\nThe project source code can be found on our GitHub page: https://github.com/atom-robotics-lab/BVPICAM-RUNTIME_TERROR"

Their project, Know-Parking, was based on making a Smart Parking System that allows you to Book Parking Spots in public spaces just like you book seats for a movie show. The project used Computer Vision on live video stream from CCTV cameras to detect empty parking spots instead of installing hardware to reduce implementation and management costs. The parking layout was accordingly updated on a web interface. The web interface allowed the user to book a spot which was then blocked by a barrier in real-time. All this was demonstrated to the judges using a Simulation for better understanding. The project used ROS which is the same stack used in robots. This provided us with many interesting future aspects like indoor navigation etc.\n\nTech Stacks Used in the Project:\n\n- OpenCV and Python for Computer Vision\n- HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Interface\n- ROS (Robot Operating System) for the whole distributed system\n- Gazebo Simulator for simulating the parking space and demonstrating the OpenCV Algorithm\n- RosJS library for connecting web interface to ROS Master\n\nThe project source code can be found on our GitHub page: https://github.com/atom-robotics-lab/Know_Parking"
